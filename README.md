### 📖 Project Story – From Raw Data to Business Insights

Food delivery platforms like Swiggy generate millions of transactions every day — but behind every order lies a story about customer behavior, revenue trends, regional demand, and business opportunities.

I wanted to explore these patterns and understand:

👉 What drives food delivery sales?

👉 Which cities contribute the most?

👉 How do customer ratings vary?

👉 What does India’s food preference look like?

So I converted a raw dataset into a meaningful, interactive excel dashboard, uncovering insights that Swiggy food delivery business could use for strategic decisions.

### KPI Sales Performance Overview

• **Total Sales :** ₹53.01M

• **Total Orders :** 197.43K

• **Avg Rating :** 4.34 ★

• **Average Order Value :** ₹268.51

• **Rating Count :** 5.59M

These KPIs help monitor the platform’s overall business health.

### Monthly Sales Trend

A clean line chart shows consistent growth from February to August, helping identify seasonal demand and performance gaps.

### Weekday Ordering Pattern

**Excel bar charts reveal:**
📅 Weekends drive the highest orders

📌 Saturday is the top-performing day

📌 Tuesday and Monday see lower activity

This insight helps businesses optimize promotions and staffing.

### India's Food Preference — Veg vs Non-Veg

**Using donut charts, the dashboard highlights:**

🍗 **Non-Veg** dominates with **64%** of sales

🥗 **Veg** contributes the remaining **36%**

This split gives direction for menu planning and campaigns.

### Quarterly Business View

Despite sales fluctuations, customer **ratings** remain consistent at **4.3**, showing strong customer satisfaction.

### State-Wise Performance (Heatmap using Conditional Formatting)

**India’s states are color-coded based on sales volume:**

🔥 High-performing states

🟧 Medium-performing

⚪ Low-order regions

The heatmap helps visualize regional demand patterns quickly.

### Top 5 Revenue Cities

**Using bar charts and ranking formulas, the top contributors are:**

Bengaluru – ₹5.5M

Lucknow – ₹3.1M

Hyderabad – ₹3.1M

Mumbai – ₹3.0M

New Delhi – ₹2.8M

These cities act as major growth hubs.
